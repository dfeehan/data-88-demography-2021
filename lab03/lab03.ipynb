    "In many ways, fertility is more complex than mortality. Everyone who is born dies exactly once. On the other hand, there is no fixed number of children that women have: some women have many children, while others have none. Moreover, women who do have children can do so in many different ways: some women have children at young ages, some at older ages. The number of children women want to have may change with age, and the relationship between desired and realized fertility can be less than perfect. Generally, fertility is a complex social phenomenon that resists overly simplistic explanations. As we will start to see in this lab, though, there are still patterns and structure to human fertility that we can use to understand it better."
